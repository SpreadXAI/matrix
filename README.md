# SpreadX Matrix

**Operate a SpreadX account from your AI agent.** Install one plugin, authorize once in the browser, then just ask — *"Check my balance"*, *"Add 200 crypto English-speaking followers for @laura"*, *"Like this tweet 50 times"* — and Claude (or Codex) does it through the **spreadx MCP server**, with a dry-run preview and your approval before any real write.

> This repo is the **client** side. The MCP **server** (`spreadx-mcp-user`, an OAuth Resource Server at `https://mcp.spreadx.ai/`) lives in **`spreadx-platform`**. This repo ships the Skill, the MCP wiring, and a standalone harness — it copies no server logic and makes no authorization decisions of its own.

---

## Quickstart

**Claude Code** — install the plugin, then ask:

```
/plugin marketplace add SpreadXAI/matrix
/plugin install spreadx-matrix@spreadx-marketplace
```

That registers the `spreadx` MCP server **and** the `spreadx-agent` Skill. On first use a browser window opens for a one-time OAuth authorization. Then:

```
Check my balance
Add 200 crypto English-speaking followers for @laura
```

That's it. Read on for Codex, the standalone harness, and how the safety gate works.

---

## How it works

You speak in plain language; the agent does **not** fire off a destructive write blindly. The `spreadx-agent` Skill (and, for clients without skills, the MCP tools' own descriptions) enforce a **two-step protocol**: every write is first run as a **dry-run preview** (pool size, how many accounts would be selected, shortfall, ETA), shown to you, and only executed after you approve. Reads (balance, orders, plans) run directly.

The protocol lives in the tools, so **Codex obeys it with no Skill at all**. The Claude Skill is pure phrasing on top. And in the standalone harness, a deterministic `canUseTool` gate — not the model — is the final authority on whether a real write runs.

---

## Installation

The capability is two things: a **Skill** (phrasing/UX) and the **`spreadx` MCP server** (the actual tools). How you install them depends on your client.

| Client | Install | Authorize | Skill | Write gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `/plugin marketplace add SpreadXAI/matrix` → `/plugin install spreadx-matrix@spreadx-marketplace` | browser OAuth (once), pre-registered client id | ✅ auto-loads | editor approval UI + server guard |
| **Codex** | `codex plugin marketplace add SpreadXAI/matrix` → `/plugins` → Install | `codex mcp login spreadx` | ✅ native | Codex confirm UI + server guard |
| **Standalone harness** | `git clone` + `pnpm install` | `matrix login` (browser, once) — or `SPREADX_ACCESS_TOKEN` env / `mock` | ✅ via SDK | deterministic `canUseTool` gate (approval + caps) + server guard |

### Claude Code (plugin — installs both)

```
/plugin marketplace add SpreadXAI/matrix
/plugin install spreadx-matrix@spreadx-marketplace
```

The plugin ([`.claude-plugin/`](.claude-plugin/)) bundles the `spreadx-agent` Skill and registers the remote MCP server with the **pre-registered client id `spreadx-matrix`**. First tool use triggers the one-time browser OAuth (login via Privy, approve scopes). No tokens to paste, nothing at rest.

> **Why the pre-registered client id?** The `spreadx` server does **not** support OAuth Dynamic Client Registration (DCR). A bare `claude mcp add` defaults to DCR and fails with `Incompatible auth server: does not support dynamic client registration`. Pinning `clientId: spreadx-matrix` in the MCP config (the plugin and [`.mcp.json`](.mcp.json) both ship it) is what lets the standard Auth Code + PKCE flow proceed.

> Prefer not to use the plugin? Register the server with the client id — `claude mcp add --transport http --client-id spreadx-matrix spreadx https://mcp.spreadx.ai/` — and optionally copy `skills/spreadx-agent/` into your project's `.claude/skills/`.

### Codex

The repo ships a Codex plugin too ([`.codex-plugin/`](.codex-plugin/)) bundling the skill and the MCP server:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add SpreadXAI/matrix
# then open /plugins, search "SpreadX", Install
```

Or add the server manually — pin the same pre-registered client id (Codex uses snake_case `client_id`, the plugin ships it for you):

```bash
codex mcp add --url https://mcp.spreadx.ai/ --oauth-client-id spreadx-matrix spreadx
```

…which writes this to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.spreadx]
url = "https://mcp.spreadx.ai/"

[mcp_servers.spreadx.oauth]
client_id = "spreadx-matrix"
```

The `oauth.client_id` is required for the same reason as Claude Code: the `spreadx` server doesn't do Dynamic Client Registration, so a bare `url`-only entry fails to authorize. Then authorize once with `codex mcp login spreadx`. The tools' own descriptions carry the dry-run/confirm protocol, so it holds even without the skill; Codex writes are gated by the **server-side** guard plus Codex's own confirm UI. Full notes: [`docs/codex-setup.md`](docs/codex-setup.md).

### Standalone harness (scripts / headless)

A `matrix` CLI that drives the agent programmatically, with the deterministic write gate built in.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpreadXAI/matrix && cd matrix
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env          # set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; SPREADX_MCP_URL=mock for offline dev
node --env-file=.env --import tsx src/harness/cli.ts "Check my balance"
```

`SPREADX_MCP_URL=mock` runs against a built-in in-process mock — no platform, no token — so you can try the flow today. For the real server, authorize once with **`matrix login`** (browser Auth Code + PKCE with a fixed pre-registered client id → a rotating refresh token stored in the **macOS Keychain** by default, or a 0600 file at `~/.config/spreadx-matrix/credentials.json` elsewhere); the harness then refreshes the access token before each run, so it can run unattended. `matrix status` shows whether you're logged in; `matrix logout` forgets the stored credentials. See [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md) for every env var and option.

---

## The Basic Workflow

Once installed, the loop for any task is the same four phases:

1. **Authorize (once)** — the client runs the OAuth flow in your browser. The grant is held by the authorization server; you won't log in again.
2. **Ask in natural language** — the `spreadx-agent` Skill maps your request to the right `mcp__spreadx__*` tool. Reads return immediately.
3. **Preview before writing** — for a follow/engagement plan, the agent calls the tool with no `confirmation_token` first and shows you the dry-run (and a confirm dialog: target, count, ETA, credits): pool size, would-select, **shortfall band** (`≤5%` proceed · `5–10%` ask · `>10%` don't), and ETA.
4. **Approve, then execute** — on your go-ahead it re-calls with the preview's `confirmation_token`. In the harness this passes through the gate (your `y/N`, or headless auto-approve within caps); in editors it's the client's own approval UI. The server rejects any write whose shortfall exceeds 10%.

Then **check status** (`list_plans` to enumerate, `get_plan` for one) any time. The same workflow covers `create_follow_plan` (add followers) and `create_engagement_plan` (like / retweet / comment).

```
You:    Add 200 crypto English-speaking followers for @laura
Agent:  [dry-run] pool 1,000 · would select 200 · shortfall 0 (ok) · ETA ~12m. Proceed?
You:    ok
Agent:  [confirm] plan mock-plan-1 created ✅
```

## Usage — what to say

Talk to the agent in plain language; it maps your words to the right `mcp__spreadx__*` tool. Reads return immediately; **writes always preview first and wait for your approval** (see the workflow above). Reply in any language — the agent answers in the one you used.

| Want to… | Say something like… |
|---|---|
| Check balance / points | `Check my balance` · `How many points do I have?` · `What's in my package?` |
| See recharge orders | `List my recharge orders` · `Show order ord_123` |
| List campaigns / plans | `List my plans` · `How are my campaigns doing?` |
| Check one plan's progress | `Show plan plan_123` · `How's my @laura follower plan going?` |
| Add followers | `Add 200 crypto English-speaking followers for @laura` · `Grow @laura by 500 followers, turbo` · `Get @bob 1,000 followers asap` |
| Like / retweet / comment | `Like this tweet 50 times <url>` · `Retweet and like <url> 100× each` · `viral_burst — like <url> 50×` |

**Followers — picking a speed.** If you don't name a delivery speed, the agent shows a **three-preset menu** — `standard` / `boost` / `turbo` — with each tier's estimated completion time and its **credit cost** (priced per speed via `estimate_follow_cost`, since faster tiers cost more), so you can compare before choosing. Name a speed up front (e.g. *"…, turbo"*) to skip the menu.

**Engagement — picking a curve.** Engagement delivery is spread over a fixed **~48h** window; the speed selects the *shape*, not the pace — `viral_burst` (front-loaded), `natural_growth` (balanced, the default), or `sustained_heat` (even all-day). If you don't name one, the agent shows a **three-curve menu** with each curve's `Est. completion` (~48h) and `Est. credits` (per-op-type cost, e.g. `like 10×50 + comment 30×10 = …`). Both columns are **identical across curves** — only the delivery shape differs — so the menu is really a shape picker. Name a curve up front to skip the menu.

**Writes are two-step.** Any `create_*` request is shown as a dry-run first (target, count, ETA, credits, pool shortfall) and only runs after you say yes — *`ok`* / *`go ahead`*. Say no to stop; nothing is written until you approve.

## What's Inside

**Tools** (exposed to the agent as `mcp__spreadx__<tool>`):

| Tool | Kind | Scope (server-enforced) | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_balance` | read | `balance:read` | points / wallet / package |
| `list_orders` | read | `orders:read` | recharge orders (keyset paging) |
| `get_order` | read | `orders:read` | one order |
| `list_plans` | read | `orders:read` | the caller's plans (keyset paging) |
| `get_plan` | read | `orders:read` | one plan incl. its progress |
| `estimate_follow_cost` | read | `balance:read` | price a follower plan across all three speeds (for the speed menu) |
| `create_follow_plan` | **write** | `plans:write` | add followers to a user |
| `create_engagement_plan` | **write** | `plans:write` | like / retweet / comment on a tweet |

**Components in this repo:**

- `.claude-plugin/` — the Claude Code plugin (marketplace + manifest) bundling the Skill and MCP server
- `.codex-plugin/` — the Codex plugin (manifest + `mcp.json`) — same Skill and MCP server, for Codex
- `skills/spreadx-agent/SKILL.md` — the Skill (UX phrasing over the tools), shared by both plugins (symlinked into `.claude/skills/` so the harness loads it too)
- `.mcp.json` — project-mode MCP mount (for cloning this repo directly)
- `docs/codex-setup.md` — Codex setup
- `src/auth/` — the OAuth client: `matrix login` (discovery + PKCE with a fixed pre-registered client id), refresh-token store (macOS Keychain / 0600 file), and `resolveAccessToken` (refresh-on-run)
- `src/core/tools.ts` — the tool registry (single source of truth for the 8 tools; gate + harness derive from it)
- `src/core/spreadx-tools.json` — vendored snapshot of the platform tool surface; the CI guardrail (`src/core/tools.guardrail.test.ts`) asserts the registry never names a tool the server doesn't expose (`registry ⊆ manifest`)
- `src/core/writeGate.ts` — the deterministic `canUseTool` safety gate (fail-safe: unknown spreadx tools require approval, non-spreadx tools are denied)
- `src/harness/{client,cli}.ts` — the Agent SDK harness + `matrix` CLI
- `src/mock/` — in-process dev mock (balance + follow + estimate), so the harness runs offline

**The safety gate** (harness): read tools and write *previews* are auto-allowed; a real write (a call carrying a `confirmation_token`) must pass an amount cap (`MATRIX_MAX_FOLLOW` / `MATRIX_MAX_ENGAGEMENT`) and then approval (interactive `y/N`, or `MATRIX_AUTO_APPROVE=1` headless). It **fails closed** on a missing/invalid count or any non-spreadx tool, and write tools are deliberately kept out of the SDK's `allowedTools` so they can't be auto-approved around the gate. Enforced by code, locked by tests — independent of the model.

## Updating

```
/plugin marketplace update spreadx-marketplace    # fetch the latest version
```

Uninstall with `/plugin uninstall spreadx-matrix`. For the harness, `git pull && pnpm install`.

---

## Security

No secrets in config. The plugin/editor path uses client-managed OAuth (no token in any config). The harness authorizes once with `matrix login` and keeps a rotating refresh token in the **macOS Keychain** (encrypted at rest) or a 0600 file — never in `.env`; `SPREADX_ACCESS_TOKEN` remains only as an optional one-off env override. `.env` and `.mcp.local.json` are git-ignored — never commit a token. Revocation lives in the OAuth layer (the platform AS / dashboard); the access token's short TTL bounds any leak, and refresh-token rotation invalidates a stolen refresh token on next use.

---

## Status & roadmap

- ✅ **Client, end to end** — plugin, Skill, editor config, harness, OAuth client (`matrix login` / `status` / `logout` with a fixed pre-registered client id and a Keychain/0600 token store), deterministic write gate, and in-process mock. Implemented and covered by a **deterministic unit-test suite** (`pnpm test`).
- ✅ **Real server live** — `mcp.spreadx.ai` is deployed and serving RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata (unauthenticated calls return 401). The full OAuth discovery chain is verified against production: AS `https://platform-api.spreadx.ai/` advertises authorize endpoint `https://app.spreadx.ai/oauth/authorize`, S256 PKCE, `token_endpoint_auth_method=none`, and scopes `balance:read orders:read plans:write offline_access` for the seeded `spreadx-matrix` client (no dynamic registration). Point the harness at it with `SPREADX_MCP_URL=https://mcp.spreadx.ai/` and run `matrix login`; the `mock` path stays for offline dev.
- ⏳ **Live model run** — the model-driven tool loop hasn't yet been exercised end to end against a live model (it needs an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). Everything beneath it — the gate, config, tool registry, and mock — is already proven by the test suite and by no-key runtime smokes.
